Codes needs to refactor:

1. weapon logic
2. currently grid based movement only handles player input, we should make a more generalized class that does it for enemies too
3. make some sort of base "movement" or "intent" class like discussed in lecture to handle all types of movement
4. consolidate the player input for attacking with arrowkeymovement, and just have animation dependent on player input component
